## Do you have any questions of your own?

- How should we start this off?
- How can we make a display graphic (pictures, different font, display boxes) with what we have learned so far.
- What research can we conduct to make sure we are maintaining academic honesty.
- How can we narrow down our searches to find the code we need?
